    <h1>Project: C - Variables, if, else, while</h1>
    <p>This project is part of the curriculum of the Holberton School and it aims to introduce the novice students to
        the basic concepts of variables, control flow statements, and loops in C programming language. The project
        covers the following topics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Data types such as char, int, and unsigned int</li>
        <li>Arithmetic operators and their use</li>
        <li>Logical operators and their use</li>
        <li>Relational operators and their use</li>
        <li>The concept of true and false in C</li>
        <li>The use of if and if...else statements</li>
        <li>Commenting in C</li>
        <li>Declaration and assignment of variables</li>
        <li>Printing the values of variables using printf</li>
        <li>The use of while loops</li>
        <li>ASCII character set</li>
        <li>Purpose of gcc flags -m32 and -m64</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <p>By the end of this project, the student is expected to be able to explain the following topics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them</li>
        <li>What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them</li>
        <li>What the relational operators are and how to use them</li>
        <li>What values are considered true and false in C</li>
        <li>What are the boolean operators and how to use them</li>
        <li>How to use the if, if...else statements</li>
        <li>How to use comments</li>
        <li>How to declare variables of types char, int, and unsigned int</li>
        <li>How to assign values to variables</li>
        <li>How to print the values of variables of type char, int, and unsigned int with printf</li>
        <li>How to use the while loop</li>
        <li>How to use variables with the while loop</li>
        <li>How to print variables using printf</li>
        <li>What is the ASCII character set</li>
        <li>What is the purpose of the gcc flags -m32 and -m64</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Allowed editors: <code>vi</code>, <code>vim</code>, <code>emacs</code></li>
        <li>All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using <code>gcc</code>, using the options
            <code>-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89</code>
        </li>
        <li>All your files should end with a new line</li>
        <li>A <code>README.md</code> file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository</li>
        <li>A <code>README.md</code> file, at the root of the folder of this project, containing a description of the
            project</li>
        <li>There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation</li>
