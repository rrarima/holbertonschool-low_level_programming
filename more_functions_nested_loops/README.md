    <h1>Project: More Functions, More Nested Loops</h1>
    <p>This project is part of the curriculum of the Holberton School and it aims to reinforce the knowledge of novice
        students in C programming language by introducing more nested loops and functions. The project covers the
        following topics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Understanding nested loops and how to use them</li>
        <li>Understanding functions and how to use them</li>
        <li>The difference between a declaration and a definition of a function</li>
        <li>Understanding prototype functions</li>
        <li>Understanding the scope of variables</li>
        <li>The gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89</li>
        <li>Understanding header files and how to use them with #include</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <p>By the end of this project, the student is expected to be able to explain the following topics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What are nested loops and how to use them</li>
        <li>What is a function and how to use functions</li>
        <li>The difference between a declaration and a definition of a function</li>
        <li>What is a prototype function</li>
        <li>Understanding the scope of variables</li>
        <li>The gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89</li>
        <li>Understanding header files and how to use them with #include</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Allowed editors: <code>vi</code>, <code>vim</code>, <code>emacs</code></li>
        <li>All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra
            -pedantic -std=gnu89</li>
        <li>All your files should end with a new line</li>
        <li>A <code>README.md</code> file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory</li>
        <li>Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl</li>
        <li>You are not allowed to use global variables</li>
        <li>No more than 5 functions per file</li>
        <li>You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like <code>printf</code>,
            <code>puts</code>, etc… is forbidden
        </li>
        <li>You are allowed to use <code>_putchar</code></li>
        <li>You don’t have to push <code>_putchar.c</code>, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into
            account</li>
        <li>In the following examples, the <code>main.c</code> files are shown as examples. You can use them to test
            your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We
            will use our own <code>main.c</code> files at compilation. Our <code>main.c</code> files might be different
            from the one shown in the examples.</li>
        <li>The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function <code>_putchar</code> should be
            included in your header file called <code>main.h</code>.</li>
        <li>Don’t forget to push your header file.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>More Info</h2>
    <p>You do not have to understand the call by reference (address), stack, static variables, recursions or arrays,
        yet.</p>
