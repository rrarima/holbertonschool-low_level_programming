    <h1>Project: C - Pointers, arrays and strings</h1>
    <p>This project aims to familiarize the student with the concepts of pointers, arrays, and strings in the C
        programming language.</p>
    <h2>Resources</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>C - Arrays</li>
        <li>C - Pointers</li>
        <li>C - Strings</li>
        <li>Memory Layout</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <p>At the end of this project, the student is expected to be able to explain:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What pointers are and how to use them</li>
        <li>What arrays are and how to use them</li>
        <li>What the differences between pointers and arrays are</li>
        <li>How to use strings and how to manipulate them</li>
        <li>The scope of variables</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs</li>
        <li>All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic
            -std=gnu89</li>
        <li>All files should end with a new line</li>
        <li>A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory</li>
        <li>Code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl</li>
        <li>Global variables are not allowed</li>
        <li>No more than 5 functions per file</li>
        <li>Standard library functions like printf, puts, etc. are forbidden</li>
        <li>The _putchar function is allowed</li>
        <li>Donâ€™t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file</li>
        <li>The prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in the header
            file called main.h</li>
        <li>The header file should be pushed along with the code</li>
        <li>The student does not need to learn about pointers to functions, pointers to pointers, multidimensional
            arrays, arrays of structures, malloc, and free yet.</li>
    </ul>
