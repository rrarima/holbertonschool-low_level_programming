        <li>Or, you can clone the <code>0x1B.c</code> repository into the <code>makefiles</code> folder.</li>
        <li>If youâ€™re going to clone it, you should enter the <code>makefiles</code> folder and inside this folder
            delete the <code>.git</code> folder using this command <code>rm -rf .git</code>, then move the files from
